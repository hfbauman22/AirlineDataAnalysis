# Analysis of Airline Flights From 1987-2020
### Harry Bauman

## Introduction

I found that as an industry, airlines have become more conservative in their estimates of flight times over the last 30 years. In other words, airlines in 2020 increased their allocation of buffer time for unexpected delays. Furthermore, more popular airlines (those with a greater proportion of yearly flights) seem to have an unpublicized rule of thumb to overestimate the flight time by a factor of 1.02.

- What will your supporting arguments be for your discovery?

## Dataset

I used the flight data [available from IBM](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/airline/). The main data set contains records from approximately 200 million domestic US flights reported to the Untied States Bureau of Transportation Statistics. IBM provides this data set to aid the training of artifical intelligence and other computational models that predict the likelihood of a flight arriving on time. However, since the full data set is 81GB, I used the 2 million row sample data set that IBM generated by randomly sampling the full data set (which is only about 7GB).

Just like the computer scientists at IBM, I'm interested in understanding the airline industry's behavior in predicting and completing their flights.
